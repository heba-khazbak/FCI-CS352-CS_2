JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format used for storing and exhanging data. It uses human-readable text to transmit data objects and easy for machines to parse and generate. It can be parsed by a standard JavaScript function.

Also, JSON is an easier-to-use alternative to XML with higher and better performance and a language-independent data format. It is based on a subset of the JavaScript scripting language and uses its syntax hence, no extra software is needed to work with JSON within JavaScript.
