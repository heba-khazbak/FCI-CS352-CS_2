JSP stands for JavaServer Pages. As it runs on the server, you need to have a web server with a servlet container such as Apache TomCat, Blazix or others. JSP simply puts Java inside HTML pages. Your jsp file gets compiled on the server after being turned into a java file. The compliation happens each time you change something in the code. JSP is then able to generate dynamic HTML pages. It means that they change in response to user actions and they produce a different user interface from user to user.
