JSP stands for JavaServer Pages. As it runs on the server, you need to have a web server with a servlet container such as Apache TomCat, Blazix or others. JSP simply puts Java inside HTML pages. Your jsp file gets compiled on the server after being turned into a java file. The compliation happens each time you change something in the code.
